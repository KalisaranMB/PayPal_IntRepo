    <description>This custom metadata type will be used to decide which named credential can be used while making callouts to PayPal. 
When a callout is happening on behalf of the teammate action (either real-time or asynchronous), the API authentication will happen on behalf of the teammate and we will be using JWT Token Exchange authentication scheme which will pass the teammate id in the subject for Identity to use.
When a callout is happening in the non-teammate action (batch, inbound APIs and so on), we will use oAuth without attaching any information about the teammate.</description>
